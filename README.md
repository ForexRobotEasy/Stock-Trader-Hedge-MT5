## Libraries Used:

The program includes the following necessary library:

- Trade.mqh: This library provides the necessary functions and classes for trading operations in MetaTrader.

## Constants:

The program defines the following constants:

- MAX_TRADES: Maximum number of trades allowed.
- TRADE_VOLUME: Volume of each trade.

## Trading Advisor Initialization:

The program initializes the trading advisor using the CTrade class:

CTrade HedgeTrader;
```

## Trading Function:

The code defines a trading function named Trade(). This function is responsible for checking available margin, obtaining technical indicators, and executing trades based on the trading conditions.

The trading function performs the following steps:

1. Checks if there is enough margin to open a trade.
2. Retrieves the values of various technical indicators (moving average, average true range, commodity channel index, stochastic oscillator, and relative strength index).
3. Checks if the trading conditions are met.
4. Opens a long position using the HedgeTrader.Buy() function if the conditions are met.

## Main Function:

The code defines the main function named OnTick(). This function is triggered on every tick and is responsible for determining if enough time has passed since the last trade, and if so, calls the Trade() function to perform a trade.

The main function performs the following steps:

1. Checks if enough time has passed since the last trade (24 hours in this case).
2. Calls the Trade() function to perform a trade if enough time has passed.

## Deinitialization Function:

The code defines the deinitialization function named OnDeinit(). This function is triggered when the program is being deinitialized and is responsible for closing all open trades.

The deinitialization function performs the following steps:

1. Closes all open trades using the HedgeTrader.CloseAll() function.
2. Prints a message indicating that all open trades have been closed.
